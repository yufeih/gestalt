     * `end`: Aligns items to the end of the Masonry container. Items will be placed starting from the right, moving leftwards, which may leave space on the left side of the container.
     * Using the `align` property can help control the visual balance and alignment of the grid, especially in responsive layouts or when dealing with varying item widths.
